**My Portfolio. I expect this will change over the years. But welcome to version 1.0**

After many hours following React tutorials, I wanted to create something from scratch and put my skills to use. Like all developers, I also needed to showcase my work!

I started by researching a lot of other devloper porfolios. I was looking for something simple to read, but also stylish. Brittany Chang was a big influnec, I hope I didn't borrow from her too heavily. Decide for yourself -> https://brittanychiang.com/

**Figma:**

I started by going into a lot of detail with the design - it actually took me longer than it did to write the code. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.

**dependencies:**

I used Animate on Scroll (AOS) for the animation effects. Really easy to set up and use.

**Set Up**

If you would like to use the site, simply make sure to run NPM install.

**Notes:**

Feel free to fork and use this design. Please let me know if you do! Also, please make sure to link back to my github.

**TO DO:**

I would like to add a messaging function so viewers can send me a message directly without having to be redirected to my gmail.
