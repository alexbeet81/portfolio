**My Portfolio. I expect this will change over the years. But welcome to version 1.0**

After many hours following React tutorials, I wanted to create something from scratch and put my skills to use. Like all developers, I also needed to showcase my work!

I started by researching a lot of other devloper porfolios. I was looking for something simple to read, but also stylish. Brittany Chang was a big influnec, I hope I didn't borrow from her too heavily. Decide for yourself -> https://brittanychiang.com/

**Figma:**

I started by going into a lot of detail with the design - it actually took me longer than it did to write the code. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.
